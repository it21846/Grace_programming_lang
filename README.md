# Grace_programming_lang
Writing a compiler for a imaginary language called grace.

This project is an assignment of the course "Compilers" of Harokopio University of Athens.

To run the compiler you have to just type "make" in your terminal window.
Requirements for the compiler to run properly are the following:
    - gcc
    - flex
    - bison
    
This Part-1 of the assignment is still under development...
